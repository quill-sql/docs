Setting up with a hosted server uses Quill's existing services to manage your dashboards, including our hosted portal and server.

### Step 1: Set up the database/server connection

**Create a read-only database user for Quill**

`CREATE USER quill_read_only WITH PASSWORD 'password';`

Note: This allows our hosted server to access your database when creating dashboards. For self-hosted options, please see the [Self-Hosted Quickstart](https://docs.quillsql.com/quickstart/Self_Hosted_Quickstart).

**Navigate to our hosted portal [(withquill.com)](https://withquill.com) and enter your database credentials. Contact Quill to create an account.**

    marginLeft: 4,

    borderRadius: 12,
    borderWidth: 0.5,
    borderColor: "#E7E7E7",
  }}
/>

### Step 2: Create your first Dashboard on the portal

Again on our hosted portal, create your first dashboard:

SCREENSHOT

The Dashboard name entered into the portal will correspond to the name prop passed into the `Dashboard` component:

```jsx
<Dashboard name="exampleDashboard" />
```

### Step 3: Set up the Quill React library

**Install the npm library**

```bash
npm install @quillsql/react
```

**Import and use the relevant components in your codebase**

QuillProvider wraps all Quill components, and provides relevant credentials through `publicKey` and information about which customer's data should be displayed through `organizationId`. Please reference the [API Reference](https://docs.quillsql.com/components/docs#quillprovider) for more details:

<CodeGroup>

```jsx App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";
import Routes from "./Routes";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

function App() {
  // your existing auth user
  const [user] = useContext(UserContext);
  return (
    <QuillProvider publicKey="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" organizationId={organizationId}>
      <Routes />
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Implicitly from the props provided (`publicKey`, `organizationId`), React components will now retrieve relevant information from the database/server connection established with our hosted server.
