Self-hosting the backend logic required to create and use Quill components allows you to avoid exposing your database connection string and handling sensitive data off-premise.

### Step 1: Set up the database/server connection

The SDK holds the core of our backend logic. By adding it to your server, you're ensuring that all backend processing for Quill dashboards happens in your server.

**Install the Quill SDK on your self-hosted server**

<CodeGroup>

```bash Node
npm i @quillsql/node --save
```

```bash Python
pip install quillsql
```

```bash Go
go get https://github.com/quill-sql/quill-go
```

</CodeGroup>

**Instantiate Quill with your credentials and use within a `POST` endpoint**

Create a new `POST` endpoint where `quill.query` will be used. This endpoint will later be called by our frontend component library, and allows the components to query the database through your server:

<CodeGroup>

```jsx Node.js
const quill = require("@quillsql/node")({
  privateKey: process.env.QULL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  databaseConnectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_READ,
});

// POST endpoint you create for quill
// "authenticateJWT" is your own pre-existing auth middleware
app.post("/quill", authenticateJWT, async (req, res) => {
  // assuming user fetched via auth middleware has an organizationId
  const { organizationId } = req.user;
  const { metadata } = req.body;
  const result = await quill.query({
    orgId: organizationId,
    metadata,
  });
  res.send(result);
});
```

```python Python
from quillsql import Quill

quill = Quill(
  private_key=os.environ.get("QUILL_PRIVATE_KEY"),
  database_connection_string=os.environ.get("POSTGRES_READ")
)

# POST endpoint you create for quill
@app.route('/quill', methods=['POST'])
# "token_required" is your own pre-existing auth middleware
@token_required
def quill_endpoint():
  data = request.json
  # assuming current user comes from existing auth
  # org_id is the id on the organizations table that you use with quill (ex: organizations, businesses, companies, stores etc)
  return quill.query(current_user.org_id, data)
```

```go Go
import (
    "github.com/quill-sql/quill-go"
)


client := quill.NewClient(quill.ClientParams{PrivateKey: os.Getenv("QUILL_PRIVATE_KEY"), DatabaseConnectionString: os.Getenv("POSTGRES_READ")})

// Add an endpoint
http.HandleFunc("/quill", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
// fetch organizationID from your existing auth middleware
organizationID, \_ := r.Context().Value(OrganizationIDContextKey).(string)

    // Convert json body.metadata to RequestMetadata
    body := &quill.RequestBody{}
    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(body)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    result, err := client.Query(organizationID, body.Metadata)
    if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
       return
    }
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(result)

})
```

</CodeGroup>

Our SDK requires no additional authentication or configuration beyond instantiating as demonstrated above!

### Step 2: Set up the self-hosted portal

Our frontend admin library acts as a self-hosted portal, where you can access, manage, and manipulate your client's dashboards. Under the hood, it's using the `@quillsql/react` npm package.

**Install the Quill Admin package**

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @quillsql/admin
````

</CodeGroup>

**Import and use the Admin component in your codebase**

By providing your server endpoint through `queryEndpoint` and the necessary authentication through `queryHeaders`, the `Admin` component is able to authenticate with your server and access your database through the SDK. This keeps all sensitive data-handling and querying on your server:

<CodeGroup>

```jsx App.js
import { Admin } from "@quillsql/admin";

function App() {

  return (
  <Admin
    // POST endpoint on your server for quill requests
    queryEndpoint="https://api.yourserver.com/quill"
    // we pass this to the endpoint url as a header on every request
    queryHeaders={{ Authorization: `Bearer ${user.jwt}` }}
    publicKey="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
  />;
  )
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Note: The admin dashboard assumes that organization management for customers is handled outside of the `Admin` component.

### Step 3: Create your first Dashboard on your self-hosted portal

Use your newly created portal to create your first dashboard.

SCREENSHOT

The Dashboard name entered into the portal will correspond to the name prop passed into the `Dashboard` component:

```jsx
<Dashboard name="exampleDashboard" />
```

### Step 4: Set up the Quill React Library

**Install the npm library**

```bash
npm install @quillsql/react
```

**Import and use the relevant components in your codebase, including QuillProvider**

QuillProvider wraps all Quill components, and provides credentials and routing information. Similar to the Admin props, this gives our components access to your database through the SDK. Once again, use `queryEndpoint` to specify the `POST` endpoint the Quill SDK is used in. Please reference the [API Reference](https://docs.quillsql.com/components/docs#quillprovider) for more details:

<CodeGroup>

```jsx App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";
import Routes from "./Routes";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

function App() {
  // your existing auth user
  const [user] = useContext(UserContext);
  return (
    <QuillProvider
      // POST endpoint on your server for quill requests
      queryEndpoint="https://api.yourserver.com/quill"
      // we pass this to the endpoint url as a header on every request
      queryHeaders={{ Authorization: `Bearer ${user.jwt}` }}
      publicKey="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
      theme={THEME}
    >
      <Routes />
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Implicitly from the props provided (`queryEndpoint`, `queryHeaders`), React components will now retrieve relevant information from the database/server connection established through the SDK on your self-hosted server.
