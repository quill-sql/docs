Tenants do two things in the Quill platform. 1. separate data in a dashboard 2. allow certain organizations, users, etc to see specific reports in a dashboard. To learn more about tenancy read more [here](/bi-platform/overview#2-tenant).

<Callout type="info">
  Tenants are the core concept for multi-tenancy in Quill. Each tenant
  represents a separate organization, user, etc.
