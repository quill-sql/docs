## 1. Environments

### What is an Environment?

An Environment is a single instance of Quill. Each environment has at least one tenant, a virtual schema, and dashboards that belong to it.

You can promote changes in one environment to another environment on a report, dashboard, virtual table level.

## Common Example

A Development and Production environment.

### Development

- Points to development postgres database
- Development Environment publicKey is used in your development and staging react apps
- Development Environment privateKey is used in your development and staging server apps
- When your server's schema changes, you can test those changes on the Development Environment
- You can promote changes to the Production Environment when they are ready

### Production

- Points to production postgres database
- Production environment publicKey is used in your development and staging react apps
- Production environment privateKey is used in your development and staging server apps

## 2. Tenant

### What is a Tenant?

A tenant is a **logical partition** of data within a datasource.

### Tenant Roles

- **Owner**:

  - Controls access to data at the **virtual table** level.
  - Dashboards must only use virtual tables owned by that tenant.

- **Viewer**:
  - Can view dashboards if a **mapping** exists.
  - The mapping is a **SQL query** that defines which owners a viewer can access.

## 3. Virtual Table

### Creating a Virtual Table

To create a virtual table:

1. Navigate to the **Virtual Schema** tab.
2. Click **Create Table**.

### What is a Virtual Table?

A virtual table is:

- A **SQL query** executed on top of your datasource.
- Designed to **enforce tenancy** by requiring a tenant foreign key field (called an **owner**).
- A mechanism for **cleaning and structuring** data for reporting purposes.

> Note: A virtual table can have **multiple owners**.

## 4. Dashboard

### What is a Dashboard?

A dashboard organizes and presents reports. It includes:

- **Sections**:

  - Each section has a name and a list of reports.

- **Global Filters**:
  - Apply across all reports in the dashboard.
  - Common filters include **date filters** and tenant-level fields.

> A dashboard provides a unified interface to explore tenant-filtered, structured, and visualized data.

## 5. Report

### Creating a Report

Once you have created at least one virtual table, you can create a report.

### What is a Report?

A report is a SQL query based on the **virtual schema**. It supports the following views:

- **Chart view**
- **Tabular view** – A formatted output of the SQL query.
- **Pivot (optional)** – Adds grouping and/or aggregation to the result, useful for visualizations.

### Report Features

- **Access Control**:

  - Defines which **subset of tenants** can view the report on their dashboards.

- **Dashboard Filter Field Mappings**:
  - Used when a common field appears across multiple tables.
  - Ensures proper linkage to dashboard-level filters.

### Report Placement

- A report can be assigned to only **one dashboard**.
- It can be placed in only **one section** within that dashboard.

### Promoting a report

- You can promote a report from one dashboard to another, in the same environment

## Summary

The virtual table reporting model consists of:

1. **Virtual Tables**: SQL-based, tenant-aware cleaned data structures.
2. **Reports**: Charted and tabular queries built from virtual tables.
3. **Tenants**: Access control units for data partitioning and security.
4. **Dashboards**: Grouped reports with global filters and sectioning.

This structure ensures multi-tenant, clean, and secure reporting across your datasource.
