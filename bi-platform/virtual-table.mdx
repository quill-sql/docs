<Note>
  This guide assumes you have already connected your database with Quill. If you
  haven't done that yet, check out our onboarding guide
  [here](/bi-platform/quickstart).
</Note>

When you first get started with the Quill platform, you only see the initial views you created in the onboarding flow.

### 1. Create a virtual table

To add a new SQL virtual table, you can click `Add virtual table +` to open a SQL Editor that shows the visible tables that Quill can see in your schema.

<Tip>
  SQL virtual tables can help you organize and group different data together to
  make it easier to build charts and tables on top of.
</Tip>

### 2. Edit the virtual table and save

Go ahead and write some SQL for a new virtual table that you would like to create. Run the query by clicking `Run Query` and make sure the data looks correct.

Give your new virtual table a descriptive, clear name and then hit `Create virtual table` to add the virtual table to Quill. You can now query data from that virtual table in charts and dashboards.

### 3. Manage your virtual tables

If you ever want to edit or delete an existing virtual table, click on the virtual table in the SQL virtual tables list to open the virtual table manager.

<Warning>
  Be careful when editing and deleting virtual tables! Make sure the charts that
  reference that virtual table are up to date so they don't get out of sync.
</Warning>

### Next Steps

Now that you have a virtual table, you're ready to start using Quill! You can come back at any time and add more dashboards, reports, and virtual tables.
