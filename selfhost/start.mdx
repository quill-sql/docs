Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This short tutorial gets you up and running with Quill self hosting. Instead of hosting a Docker container, all you need to do is create an endpoint using our sdk and a few lines of code.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

Install Quill React npm package in your React repo:

```bash
yarn add @quillsql/react
```

## Step 2: Connect Quill to React

You connect Quill to React with the `QuillProvider` component. Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In App.js, let's wrap our React app with an `QuillProvider`. We suggest putting the `QuillProvider` somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access Quill data.

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";
import Routes from "./Routes";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

function App() {
  // your existing auth user
  const [user] = useContext(UserContext);
  return (
    <QuillProvider
      // POST endpoint on your server for quill requests
      endpoint="https://api.yourserver.com/quill"
      // we pass this to the endpoint url as a header on every request
      authHeader={{ Authorization: `Bearer ${user.jwt}` }}
      theme={THEME}
    >
      <Routes />
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```

## Step 3: Create endpoint on your Node.js server

Now it's time to create the endpoint we referenced in the provider. Simply instantiate our sdk and call the query function in your endpoint.

Note that we assume you have an organization id on the user returned by your auth middleware. Queries will not work properly without the user's organization id.

```js server.js
const quill = require("@quillsql/quill-sdk-node")({
  publicKey: process.env.QULL_PUBLIC_KEY,
  privateKey: process.env.QUILL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  databaseConnectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_STAGING_READ,
  stagingDatabaseConnectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_STAGING_READ,
});

// "authenticateJWT" is your own pre-existing auth middleware
app.post("/quill", authenticateJWT, async (req, res) => {
  // assuming user fetched via auth middleware has an organizationId
  const { organizationId } = req.user;
  const { query, filters, environment, quillId } = req.body;
  const result = await quill.query({
    organizationId,
    query,
    filters,
    environment,
    quillId,
  });
  res.send(result);
});
```
