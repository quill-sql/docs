Traditionally in Business Intelligence products, there are 2 architectures, each with their own set of problems.

| Architecture    | Description                                                            | Problems                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud**       | A web app that you embed via an iframe                                 | Limited customization, security concerns, performance issues         |
| **Self-hosted** | A docker container or kubernetes cluster hosted on your infrastructure | Complex setup, maintenance overhead, still requires iframe embedding |

By building backend and frontend logic into your existing stack, we solved these problems.
