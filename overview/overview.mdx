## How it works

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="1. Connect a data source"
    icon="database"
    href="/datasources/postgres"
  >
    Select your database or warehouse and choose what data to make available.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="2. Create dashboards in the Quill portal"
    icon="chart-simple"
    href="/portal"
  >
    Quill portal provides a single source of truth for customer-facing
    dashboards + reports, and allows non-engineers to create and update
    dashboards without looping in engineers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Add components to your app" icon="grid-2" href="/components">
    Install our npm package and add Quill Dashboards, Charts, and more anywhere
    in your app.
  </Card>
