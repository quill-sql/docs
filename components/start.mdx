### 1. Install dependencies

Install `@quillsql/react` using your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @quillsql/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @quillsql/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @quillsql/react
```

```bash bun
bun add @quillsql/react
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Add QuillProvider

You connect Quill to React with the `QuillProvider` component. Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In App.js, let's wrap our React app with an `QuillProvider`. We suggest putting the `QuillProvider` somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access Quill data.

<Tip>
	You can find your **organizationId** and **publicKey** from the portal at
	https://app.quill.co.
</Tip>

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";
import Routes from "./Routes";

function App() {
	return (
		<QuillProvider organizationId={organizationId} publicKey={API_KEY}>
			<Routes />
		</QuillProvider>
	);
}
```

### 3. Add your first component

After your QuillProvider is hooked up, you can add Quill Components to your app. Let's start with the dashboard we created in the [portal tutorial](/portal).

Note that the underlying queries and charts are updated via the Quill Portal, and the dashboard will render them.

<Tip>
	If you forget, you can always find the dashboard **name** in the portal at
	https://app.quill.co.
</Tip>

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider, Dashboard } from "@quillsql/react";

function App() {
	return (
		<QuillProvider
			organizationId={organizationId}
			publicKey={API_KEY}
			theme={THEME}>
			<Dashboard
				name='spend_dashboard'
				containerStyle={{ width: "100%", height: 400 }}
			/>
		</QuillProvider>
	);
}
```
