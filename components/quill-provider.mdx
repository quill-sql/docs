description: "Wrap your app with Quill context"

```tsx App.tsx
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";

function App() {
	return (
		<QuillProvider
			publicKey={process.env.QUILL_API_KEY}
			organizationId={user.organizationId}
			theme={THEME}>
			/ * the rest of your app * /
		</QuillProvider>
	);
}
```

The quill provider allows all the quill components in your app to share
information which lets your dashboards render fast and update dynamically.

Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app
and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from
anywhere in your component tree. We suggest putting the QuillProvider
somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access
your quill data.
