### 1. Install dependencies

Install `@quillsql/react` using your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @quillsql/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @quillsql/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @quillsql/react
```

```bash bun
bun add @quillsql/react
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Add QuillProvider

You connect Quill to React with the `QuillProvider` component. Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In App.js, let's wrap our React app with an `QuillProvider`. We suggest putting the `QuillProvider` somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access Quill data.

<Tip>
	You can find your **organizationId** and **publicKey** from the portal at
	https://app.quill.co.
</Tip>

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";

function App() {
	// Replace organizationId and publicKey with your values
	return (
		<QuillProvider organizationId='2' publicKey='6579031b3e41c378aa8180ec'>
			<MyApp />
		</QuillProvider>
	);
}
```

### 3. Add your first component

After your QuillProvider is hooked up, you can add Quill Components to your app. Let's start with the dashboard we created in the [portal tutorial](/portal).

<Tip>
	If you forget, you can always find the dashboard **name** in the portal at
	https://app.quill.co.
</Tip>

<Info>
	With Quill, the underlying queries and charts can be updated via the Quill
	Portal, and the dashboard will render the newest version.
</Info>

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider, Dashboard } from "@quillsql/react";

function MyDashboardPage() {
	return <Dashboard name='Transactions' />;
}
```
