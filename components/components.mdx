Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This short tutorial gets you up and running with Quill Components.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

Install Quill Components npm package:

```bash
yarn add @quillsql/components
```

or

```bash
npm install @quillsql/components
```

## Step 2: Connect Quill to React

You connect Quill to React with the `QuillProvider` component. Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In App.js, let's wrap our React app with an `QuillProvider`. We suggest putting the `QuillProvider` somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access Quill data.

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/components";
import Routes from "./Routes";

function App() {
  return (
    <QuillProvider
      organizationId={organizationId}
      publicKey={API_KEY}
      theme={THEME}
    >
      <Routes />
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```

## Step 3: Add your first component

After your QuillProvider is hooked up, you can add Quill Components to your app. Let's start with the dashboard we created in the portal (link it) tutorial.

```js App.js
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/components";
import Routes from "./Routes";

function App() {
  return (
    <QuillProvider
      organizationId={organizationId}
      publicKey={API_KEY}
      authToken={user.jwt}
      theme={THEME}
    >
      <Dashboard
        name="spend_dashboard"
        containerStyle={{ width: "100%", height: 400 }}
      />
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```
