<Note>
	This guide assumes you have already connected your database with quill. If
	you haven't done that yet, check out our onboarding guide
	[here](/portal/quickstart).
</Note>

When you first get started with the Quill platform, you only see the initial views you created in the onboarding flow.

### 1. Create a view

To add a new SQL view, you can click `Add view +` to open a SQL Editor that shows the visible tables that Quill can see in your schema.

<Tip>
	SQL views can help you organize and group different data together to make it
	easier to build charts and tables on top of.
</Tip>

### 2. Edit the view and save

Go ahead and write some SQL for a new view that you would like to create. Run the query and if it looks good hit `Save changes`.

Give your new view a descriptive, clear name and then hit `Create view` to add the view to Quill. You can now query data from that view in charts and dashboards.

### 3. Manage your views

If you ever want to edit or delete an existing view, click on the view in the SQL Views list to open the view manager.

<Warning>
	Be careful when editing and deleting views! Make sure the charts that reference that view are up to date so they don't get out of sync.
</Warning>
