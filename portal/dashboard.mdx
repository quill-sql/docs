<Note>
	This guide assumes you have already connected your database with quill. If
	you haven't done that yet, check out our onboarding guide
	[here](/portal/quickstart).
</Note>

When you first get started with the Quill platform, you will see an environment without any dashboards. Click on the "create new dashboard" button to get started.

### 1. Create a dashboard

Go ahead and give your new dashboard a name.

<Tip>The dashboard name should be unique, clear, and easy to remember.</Tip>

If you would like to automatically filter every chart in this dashboard by date, you can keep the date filter option selected. Additionally, if you would like to compare this date range against historical ranges you can select the "date comparison" feature.

Finally, if you would like to automatically filter every chart in this table by a string field on your schema (eg. filtering by user, merchant, etc.) you can add as many string filters as you would like. Remember, you can always create more than one database.
