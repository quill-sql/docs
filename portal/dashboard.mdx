<Note>
	This guide assumes you have already connected your database with quill. If
	you haven't done that yet, check out our onboarding guide
	[here](/portal/quickstart).
</Note>

When you first get started with the Quill platform, you will see an environment without any dashboards. Click on the "create new dashboard" button to get started.

### 1. Create a dashboard

Go ahead and give your new dashboard a name.

<Tip>The dashboard name should be unique, clear, and easy to remember.</Tip>

If you would like to automatically filter every chart in this dashboard by date, you can keep the date filter option selected. Additionally, if you would like to compare this date range against historical ranges you can select the "date comparison" feature.

Finally, if you would like to automatically filter every chart in this table by a string field on your schema (eg. filtering by user, merchant, etc.) you can add as many string filters as you would like. Remember, you can always create more than one database.

When you're done, go ahead and hit save. You should see your dashboard in the top-left of the screen.

### 3. Manage your dashboards

If you ever want to create a new dashboard, click on the dashboard dropdown and select "New Dashboard".

You can also edit the settings for any existing dashboard by selecting that dashboard and clicking "Manage" in the dropdown.

<Frame>
	<img src='/images/manage_dashboard.png' />
</Frame>

That will open the Manage Dropdown modal which allows you to edit the title of the dashboard, add and remove filters, edit the order of charts, and delete the dashboard.

	Once you have created a dashboard, you're ready to create your first chart!
