### 1. Connect your database

Go to [app.quill.co/onboard](https://app.quill.co/onboard) using your favorite browser and enter a read-only database connection string for your database.

### 2. Connect your schema

The Quill platform provides powerful filtering and reporting tools to help you get the insights you want, faster. Let us know which table to use for your organizations and Quill will use this information to partition data by organization.

### 3. Add SQL Views

Create a cleaned schema that makes it easier to write queries and reports. The views you create here will be used to create charts and tables later on. Don't worry, you can always create and edit these views later.
