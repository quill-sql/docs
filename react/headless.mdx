title: "What is Headless UI?"
description: ""
---

"Headless" in React refers to a design pattern where UI components are separated into two parts:

1. **Logic/State Management** - The "headless" part that handles all the business logic, state, and behavior
2. **UI/Presentation** - The visual components that you style and customize

## How Headless Components Work

Headless components provide all the functionality without any default styling or visual elements. They give you:

- Data processing
- State management
- Business logic

But leave the UI completely up to you.

> The hardest parts of building complex UIs usually revolve around state, events, side-effects, data computation/management. By removing these concerns from the markup, styles and implementation details, our logic and components can be more modular and reusable.
