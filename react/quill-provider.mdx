```tsx App.tsx
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <QuillProvider
      publicKey={process.env.QUILL_API_KEY}
      tenants={[user.organizationId]}
    >
      {children}
    </QuillProvider>
  );
}
```

The quill provider allows all the quill components in your app to share
information which lets your dashboards render fast and update dynamically.

Similar to React's `Context.Provider`, `QuillProvider` wraps your React app
and places Quill Client on the context, enabling you to access it from
anywhere in your component tree. We suggest putting the QuillProvider
somewhere high in your app, above any component that might need to access
your quill data.

### With OrgId

If you're using the Quill Cloud, you can pass in your public key and the current
organizationId (if any) and the Quill Provider will automatically connect to the
hosted Quill Cloud.

```jsx With OrgId
<QuillProvider
  publicKey={process.env.QUILL_API_KEY}
  tenants={[user.organizationId]}
>
  {children}
</QuillProvider>
```

### With QueryEndpoint

If you're self-hosting Quill, you can point the Quill Provider to the location
of the server running the Quill SDK. You may also pass a map of query headers
that will be forwarded to your server with every request Quill sends. This can
be useful if the `/quill` endpoint is behind a preexisting auth middleware.

```jsx With QueryEndpoint
<QuillProvider
  publicKey={process.env.QUILL_API_KEY}
  queryEndpoint="https://yourdomain.com/quill"
  queryHeaders={{}}
>
  {children}
</QuillProvider>
```
