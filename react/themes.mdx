<Tip>
	For pixel-perfect control over theming and styling, all Quill components
	accept custom components as props. See our [dashboard
	docs](/components/dashboard.mdx) for an example.
</Tip>

```tsx App.tsx
import { QuillProvider } from "@quillsql/react";

// You can a custom theme to be applied to the default Quill
// components, or you can pass your own components with
// pixel-perfect styling.
const MY_CUSTOM_THEME = {
	fontFamily: "Inter; Helvetica",
	backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF",
	primaryTextColor: "#364153",
	secondaryTextColor: "#6C727F",
	chartLabelFontFamily: "Inter; Helvetica",
	chartLabelColor: "#666666",
	chartTickColor: "#CCCCCC",
	chartColors: ["#4E80EE", "#E14F62", "#55B5A6", "#E9A23B"],
	borderColor: "#E5E7EB",
	primaryButtonColor: "#364153",
	secondaryButtonColor: "#384151",
	borderWidth: 1,
	labelFontWeight: 500,
	fontSize: 14,
	loadingStateBackgroundColor: "#F9F9FA",
	hoverBackgroundColor: "#F4F4F5",
};

function App() {
	return (
		<QuillProvider
			publicKey={process.env.QUILL_API_KEY}
			organizationId={user.organizationId}
			theme={MY_CUSTOM_THEME}>
			{children}
		</QuillProvider>
	);
}
